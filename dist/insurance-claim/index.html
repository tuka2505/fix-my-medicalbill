Our mission is to democratize access to medical bill dispute tools so every American can fight unfair charges without hiring expensive advocates. We believe healthcare billing transparency is a fundamental right. All tools, templates, and expert guides are completely free forever, with no hidden fees or premium tiers."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I lower a high medical bill?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Start by requesting an itemized bill to audit CPT codes for errors like duplicate charges or upcoding. Use federal laws like the No Surprises Act to challenge balance billing from out-of-network providers. Compare your charges against FAIR Health Consumer data to prove you were overcharged. Finally, negotiate directly with the hospital's financial counselor, offering to pay 40-60% of the balance as a lump sum settlement."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the No Surprises Act and how does it protect me?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The No Surprises Act (effective January 2022) prohibits surprise billing for emergency services and certain non-emergency services at in-network facilities. If an out-of-network provider treats you at an in-network hospital, you only owe the in-network cost-sharing amount. Violations can be reported to CMS at 1-800-985-3059. This law is one of the strongest patient protections ever enacted and applies to most commercial insurance plans nationwide."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I dispute a medical bill that's already in collections?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely. Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), you have the right to request debt validation within 30 days of the first collection notice. Send a certified letter demanding proof of the debt, and the collector must cease all activity until they provide documentation. Many medical debts in collections cannot be validated due to poor record-keeping. If the debt is time-barred (past your state's statute of limitations), they cannot legally sue you for payment."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What should I do if my insurance claim is denied?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"First, carefully read the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) to understand the denial reason code. Common issues like incorrect CPT codes or missing prior authorization can often be fixed by your provider resubmitting the claim. For medical necessity denials, file an internal appeal citing your insurance policy's coverage language and clinical evidence supporting the treatment. Under ERISA, employer-sponsored plans must provide a full and fair review. If the internal appeal fails, request an external review by an independent third party—this process is free and overturns denials in 40-50% of cases."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I know if I qualify for charity care or financial assistance?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If you received care at a nonprofit hospital, you may qualify for free or discounted care under IRS Section 501(r). Most hospitals offer charity care to patients earning up to 400% of the Federal Poverty Level (about $60,000 for individuals, $124,000 for families of four). Request the hospital's Financial Assistance Policy (FAP) and application immediately. Hospitals cannot send your debt to collections or report it to credit bureaus until at least 120 days after the first bill, giving you time to apply for assistance."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is an itemized bill and why is it important?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"An itemized bill (also called a detailed statement) lists every charge with its corresponding CPT code, date of service, quantity, and price. This is the only way to verify you're being charged correctly. Federal law requires hospitals to provide itemized bills upon request within 30 days. Review it carefully for duplicate charges, incorrect codes, and unbundled services. Studies show that 30-80% of hospital bills contain errors. Disputing errors with evidence from an itemized bill dramatically increases your chances of a reduction."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can medical debt hurt my credit score?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"As of 2023, paid medical debt must be immediately removed from credit reports, and unpaid medical debts under $500 should not be reported at all. Additionally, medical debts cannot appear on your credit report until they are at least 180 days past due. These are significant consumer protections under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). If you're facing collections, negotiate a 'pay-for-delete' agreement where the collector removes the debt from your credit report in exchange for payment. Get this agreement in writing before sending any money."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is prior authorization and why was my treatment denied?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Prior authorization is an insurance requirement that your doctor must get approval before providing certain treatments, procedures, or medications. Denials are often based on outdated clinical guidelines or misinterpretation of medical necessity. You have the right to appeal under ERISA § 503 and request a Peer-to-Peer Review where your doctor speaks directly with the insurer's medical director. Cite Medicare coverage determinations (NCDs/LCDs) and peer-reviewed studies to strengthen your appeal. For urgent cases, demand an expedited review within 72 hours."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long do I have to dispute a medical bill?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Time limits vary by state and situation. For billing errors, act immediately—most hospitals only allow 30-90 days to dispute charges after receiving a bill. For insurance claim appeals, you typically have 180 days from the denial date to file an internal appeal. For collections debt validation, you must send your request within 30 days of the first collection notice. For balance billing violations under the No Surprises Act, you can file complaints with CMS or your state insurance department within one year. Never wait—the sooner you dispute, the stronger your case."}}]}</script><style>

The provider can correct the issue and resubmit. A denied claim was processed but the insurer refuses to pay, citing policy exclusions, lack of medical necessity, or other coverage reasons. Denied claims require a formal appeal."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long do I have to appeal an insurance claim denial?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"For ERISA-governed employer plans, you typically have 180 days from the denial date to file an internal appeal. For urgent/expedited appeals involving ongoing or imminent care, you may have as few as 72 hours. Check your denial letter for the specific deadline — missing the deadline can forfeit your right to appeal."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I appeal a claim denial even if I already paid the bill?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Paying a bill does not waive your right to appeal the insurance denial. If your appeal is successful, the insurance will reimburse you for the covered amount. Always appeal denials even if you've already paid the provider — you can still recover the money."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is a peer-to-peer review for prior authorization denials?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A peer-to-peer review is a conversation between your treating physician and the insurance company's medical director (a doctor employed by the insurer). Your doctor explains the clinical rationale for the treatment and why it's medically necessary. Peer-to-peer reviews often result in overturned denials because insurance medical directors are less likely to deny care when speaking directly with a treating physician."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Does my insurance have to tell me why my claim was denied?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Under ERISA and the ACA, insurers must provide a written denial notice explaining the specific reason for denial, the policy provision or clinical guideline being applied, and your right to appeal. If your denial letter is vague or doesn't cite specific policy language, request a detailed explanation in writing — the insurer is legally required to provide it."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is an external review and how do I request one?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"An external review is an independent evaluation of your denied claim by a third-party organization not affiliated with your insurance company. External reviews are required under federal law for most plans and are provided at no cost to you. You can request an external review after your internal appeal is denied. The external reviewer's decision is usually binding on the insurer."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I sue my insurance company for denying my claim?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"It depends on your plan type. If you have an ERISA-governed employer plan, you generally cannot sue for compensatory or punitive damages — you can only sue to recover the denied benefits. You must exhaust the internal and external appeal process before filing a lawsuit. For non-ERISA plans (individual/family plans, some government plans), state bad faith insurance laws may allow you to sue for damages if the insurer acted unreasonably or in bad faith. Consult a healthcare attorney for advice specific to your situation."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What if my insurance denies a claim because they say the treatment is experimental?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Experimental or investigational denials are common for newer treatments or off-label drug uses. To appeal, you need strong clinical evidence: peer-reviewed studies, medical society guidelines, FDA approvals, and a detailed letter from your doctor explaining why the treatment is standard of care. Cite Medicare coverage determinations if Medicare covers the treatment — insurers often follow Medicare's lead on what constitutes standard care."}}]}</script><style>

          <h1>Insurance Claim Denials: Why Claims Get Denied and How to Appeal Successfully</h1>
          
          <section class="info-section">
            <p>Insurance claim denials are one of the most frustrating experiences in American healthcare. You followed the rules, paid your premiums, and received necessary medical care — yet your insurance company denies the claim or pays less than expected.</p>
            <p>Understanding why claims get denied, how to read your Explanation of Benefits (EOB), and the specific steps to file a successful appeal can mean the difference between thousands of dollars in unexpected costs and full coverage. This guide explains the entire insurance claim and appeal process, backed by federal patient protections.</p>

          <section class="info-section">
            <h2>Understanding Insurance Claims</h2>
            <p>An <strong>insurance claim</strong> is a formal request submitted to your health insurance company asking them to pay for medical services you received. The process typically works like this:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Provider submits claim:</strong> Your doctor or hospital sends a claim to your insurance with CPT codes, diagnosis codes (ICD-10), dates of service, and charges.</li>
              <li><strong>Insurance processes claim:</strong> The insurer reviews the claim against your policy's coverage rules, medical necessity criteria, and benefit limits.</li>
              <li><strong>EOB issued:</strong> You receive an Explanation of Benefits showing what the insurer paid, what they denied, and what you owe.</li>
              <li><strong>You pay remaining balance:</strong> After insurance processes the claim, you're responsible for deductibles, copays, coinsurance, or any denied amounts.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>When a claim is <strong>denied</strong>, the insurance refuses to pay part or all of the charges. When a claim is <strong>partially paid</strong>, the insurance covers some but not all of the requested amount, leaving you with a larger balance than expected.</p>

            <h2>Most Common Reasons Insurance Claims Get Denied</h2>
            <p>Studies show that <strong>15-20% of insurance claims are initially denied</strong>, but many denials can be successfully appealed. Understanding the most common denial reasons helps you identify whether your denial is legitimate or disputable:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Lack of Medical Necessity</h3>
            <p>The insurer determines the treatment was not "medically necessary" according to their guidelines. This is the most common and most disputable denial reason. Insurers often use outdated criteria or misinterpret clinical evidence.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Missing or Incorrect Prior Authorization</h3>
            <p>Many treatments, procedures, and medications require prior authorization (pre-approval) before services are rendered. If your provider didn't obtain authorization or the authorization expired, the claim may be denied.</p>

            <h3>3. Coding Errors</h3>
            <p>Incorrect CPT codes, mismatched diagnosis codes, or unbundled services can trigger automatic denials. These are billing errors, not medical judgment calls, and should be corrected by the provider resubmitting the claim.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Out-of-Network Provider</h3>
            <p>If you received care from an out-of-network provider, your insurance may deny the claim or pay at a lower rate, leaving you with balance billing. Under the No Surprises Act, you're protected from surprise billing for emergency services and certain non-emergency services at in-network facilities.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Exclusions or Benefit Limitations</h3>
            <p>Some services are explicitly excluded from coverage (e.g., cosmetic procedures, experimental treatments). Others may have annual or lifetime benefit limits. Review your Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) to verify exclusions.</p>
            
            <h3>6. Timely Filing Limits Exceeded</h3>
            <p>Insurers require claims to be submitted within a certain timeframe (typically 90-180 days). If your provider filed late, the claim may be denied. This is the provider's responsibility, not yours.</p>
            
            <h3>7. Coordination of Benefits Issues</h3>
            <p>If you have multiple insurance plans (e.g., employer insurance + Medicare), the insurers must coordinate who pays first (primary) and second (secondary). Miscommunication between insurers can lead to denials.</p>
            
            <h3>8. Pre-Existing Condition Exclusions (Rare Post-ACA)</h3>
            <p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) prohibits pre-existing condition exclusions for most plans. However, some grandfathered plans or short-term health plans may still deny claims based on pre-existing conditions.</p>

          <section class="info-section">
            <h2>How to Read Your Explanation of Benefits (EOB)</h2>
            <p>Your <strong>Explanation of Benefits (EOB)</strong> is not a bill — it's a summary from your insurance showing what happened with your claim. Understanding your EOB is critical to identifying errors and preparing appeals.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Sections of an EOB</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Provider Name &amp; Service Date:</strong> Who provided care and when.</li>
              <li><strong>Billed Amount:</strong> What the provider charged (often much higher than what insurance pays).</li>
              <li><strong>Allowed Amount:</strong> The maximum the insurance will pay for that service based on contracted rates.</li>
              <li><strong>Deductible:</strong> The amount you must pay before insurance coverage kicks in.</li>
              <li><strong>Copay/Coinsurance:</strong> Your required cost-sharing amounts.</li>
              <li><strong>Insurance Paid:</strong> What the insurance actually paid the provider.</li>
              <li><strong>Patient Responsibility:</strong> What you owe (deductible + copay/coinsurance + any denied amounts).</li>
              <li><strong>Denial/Adjustment Reason:</strong> Codes or descriptions explaining why charges were reduced or denied.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Common EOB Denial Codes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>CO-16:</strong> Claim lacks information for adjudication (missing documentation).</li>
              <li><strong>CO-50:</strong> Non-covered service (not a benefit under your plan).</li>
              <li><strong>CO-97:</strong> Service was included in another service (bundling issue).</li>
              <li><strong>CO-151:</strong> Payment adjusted because the payer deems the information submitted does not support this level of service.</li>
              <li><strong>PR-1:</strong> Deductible not met (patient responsibility).</li>
              <li><strong>PR-2:</strong> Coinsurance amount (patient responsibility).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Look up your specific denial code on your insurer's website or call the member services number on your insurance card for clarification.</p>

          <section class="info-section">
            <h2>The Insurance Appeal Process: Step-by-Step</h2>
            <p>If your claim is denied or you believe the insurance should have paid more, you have the legal right to appeal. Under the <strong>Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)</strong>, employer-sponsored health plans must provide a full and fair review of denied claims.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 1: Review Your Denial Letter and EOB</h3>
            <p>Your insurer must send a written denial notice explaining:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The specific reason for denial</li>
              <li>The policy provision, clinical guideline, or exclusion being cited</li>
              <li>Your right to appeal and the deadline to file</li>
              <li>How to request your claim file and relevant medical criteria</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Step 2: Gather Supporting Documentation</h3>
            <p>Collect evidence to support your appeal:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Medical records:</strong> Doctor's notes, test results, treatment plans.</li>
              <li><strong>Clinical guidelines:</strong> Medical society recommendations, peer-reviewed studies, Medicare coverage determinations showing the treatment is standard of care.</li>
              <li><strong>Policy language:</strong> Your Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) and full policy document showing the service should be covered.</li>
              <li><strong>Doctor's letter:</strong> A letter of medical necessity from your treating physician explaining why the treatment was required.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Step 3: File an Internal Appeal</h3>
            <p>Submit a written appeal to your insurance company within the deadline (typically <strong>180 days</strong> from the denial date for ERISA plans). Your appeal should:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reference your claim number and denial date</li>
              <li>State exactly what you're appealing and why the denial is incorrect</li>
              <li>Attach supporting documentation (medical records, clinical guidelines, doctor's letter)</li>
              <li>Request a peer-to-peer review if the denial was based on medical necessity</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 4: Wait for Internal Appeal Decision</h3>
            <p>ERISA requires insurers to respond within specific timeframes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Urgent/expedited appeals:</strong> 72 hours</li>
              <li><strong>Pre-service appeals:</strong> 30 days (for services not yet received)</li>
              <li><strong>Post-service appeals:</strong> 60 days (for services already received)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Step 5: Request an External Review (If Internal Appeal Denied)</h3>
            <p>If your internal appeal is denied, you have the right to an <strong>external review</strong> by an independent third party at no cost to you. External reviews are conducted by independent medical professionals or attorneys who specialize in healthcare claims.</p>
            <p>External reviews overturn <strong>40-50% of denials</strong>, making this a powerful patient protection. The external reviewer's decision is usually binding on the insurance company.</p>

          <section class="info-section">
            <h2>Federal Protections for Insurance Claims</h2>
            <p>Several federal laws protect patients from unfair insurance claim denials:</p>
            
            <h3>Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)</h3>
            <p>ERISA § 503 requires employer-sponsored health plans to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Provide written reasons for denials with specific policy or clinical criteria cited</li>
              <li>Allow patients to review their claim file and insurer's evidence</li>
              <li>Provide a full and fair internal appeal process</li>
              <li>Respond to appeals within strict timeframes</li>
              <li>Allow external review if internal appeals are denied</li>
            </ul>
            <p>ERISA applies to most employer-sponsored plans. If your plan is self-insured (meaning your employer pays claims directly and just uses an insurance company for administration), ERISA is your primary protection.</p>
            
            <h3>Affordable Care Act (ACA)</h3>
            <p>The ACA extended strong consumer protections to all non-grandfathered plans:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Prohibits lifetime and annual dollar limits on essential health benefits</li>
              <li>Prohibits pre-existing condition exclusions</li>
              <li>Requires coverage of preventive services with no cost-sharing</li>
              <li>Establishes medical loss ratio rules (insurers must spend at least 80-85% of premiums on medical care)</li>
              <li>Requires external review for denied claims</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>No Surprises Act</h3>
            <p>The No Surprises Act (effective January 2022) protects patients from surprise out-of-network bills for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Emergency services (regardless of whether the facility or provider is in-network)</li>
              <li>Non-emergency services at in-network facilities when an out-of-network provider is involved without the patient's knowledge</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your insurance denies coverage claiming an out-of-network service should not be covered, cite the No Surprises Act if the situation qualifies.</p>
            
            <h3>Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA)</h3>
            <p>If your claim involves mental health or substance use disorder treatment, MHPAEA requires insurers to cover these services on par with medical/surgical benefits. Stricter prior authorization requirements or lower coverage for mental health services may violate parity laws.</p>

          <section class="info-section">
            <h2>Prior Authorization: What It Is and How to Appeal Denials</h2>
            <p><strong>Prior authorization</strong> (also called pre-approval or pre-certification) is a requirement that your doctor obtain approval from your insurance before providing certain treatments, procedures, or medications.</p>
            
            <h3>Why Prior Authorization Exists</h3>
            <p>Insurers claim prior authorization ensures medical necessity and prevents overuse of expensive services. Critics argue it delays care, increases administrative burden, and denies access to medically necessary treatments.</p>
            
            <h3>What Requires Prior Authorization?</h3>
            <p>Common services requiring prior authorization include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Inpatient hospital admissions</li>
              <li>MRI, CT, PET scans</li>
              <li>Surgery (especially elective or outpatient procedures)</li>
              <li>Specialty medications (especially biologics and brand-name drugs)</li>
              <li>Physical therapy beyond a certain number of visits</li>
              <li>Durable medical equipment (wheelchairs, CPAP machines, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What to Do If Prior Authorization Is Denied</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Request a peer-to-peer review:</strong> Ask your doctor to speak directly with the insurer's medical director to explain why the treatment is necessary.</li>
              <li><strong>Submit additional clinical evidence:</strong> Provide peer-reviewed studies, clinical guidelines, or case studies supporting the treatment.</li>
              <li><strong>File a formal appeal:</strong> Follow the internal and external appeal process described above.</li>
              <li><strong>Request an expedited review:</strong> If the delay could seriously jeopardize your health, demand an urgent/expedited decision within 72 hours.</li>

            <h2>When to Escalate Your Insurance Claim Dispute</h2>
            <p>If your internal appeal is denied and your external review is unsuccessful, you still have options:</p>
            
            <h3>File a Complaint with Your State Insurance Department</h3>
            <p>Every state has an insurance commissioner or department of insurance that investigates consumer complaints against insurers. File a formal complaint if you believe the insurer violated state insurance laws or acted in bad faith.</p>
            
            <h3>File a Complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor (for ERISA plans)</h3>
            <p>If your employer-sponsored plan violated ERISA requirements (e.g., failed to provide a full and fair review, missed appeal deadlines, didn't provide required notices), file a complaint with the DOL's Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA).</p>
            <p>Contact: 1-866-444-3272 or <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dol.gov/agencies/ebsa</a></p>
            
            <h3>File a Complaint with CMS (for ACA Marketplace plans)</h3>
            <p>If you have an ACA Marketplace plan and believe the insurer violated federal ACA requirements, file a complaint with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS).</p>
            <p>Contact: 1-800-318-2596 or <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HealthCare.gov</a></p>
            
            <h3>Consult a Healthcare Attorney or Patient Advocate</h3>
            <p>For high-dollar denials (over $10,000), consider hiring a healthcare attorney who specializes in ERISA litigation or insurance bad faith claims. Many attorneys work on contingency (taking a percentage of recovered benefits).</p>
            <p>Patient advocates can also help you navigate the appeal process, gather clinical evidence, and communicate effectively with insurers.

            <h2>Preventing Future Claim Denials</h2>
            <p>Proactive steps can reduce the likelihood of claim denials:</p>
            
            <h3>Before Receiving Care</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Verify coverage:</strong> Call your insurer before scheduling non-emergency procedures to confirm the service is covered.</li>
              <li><strong>Confirm in-network status:</strong> Verify that all providers (surgeon, anesthesiologist, radiologist, facility) are in-network.</li>
              <li><strong>Obtain prior authorization:</strong> Ensure your provider submits prior authorization requests well in advance of scheduled services.</li>
              <li><strong>Request pre-determination:</strong> Ask your insurer for a written pre-determination of benefits so you know in advance what will be covered.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>After Receiving Care</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Review EOBs promptly:</strong> Check every EOB for errors or unexpected denials.</li>
              <li><strong>Compare EOB to medical bill:</strong> Ensure the provider's bill matches what the EOB says you owe.</li>
              <li><strong>Act quickly on denials:</strong> Don't wait until the appeal deadline approaches. File appeals as soon as you identify a problem.</li>
              <li><strong>Keep detailed records:</strong> Save all bills, EOBs, denial letters, appeal submissions, and correspondence with insurers.</li>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>What is the difference between a denied claim and a rejected claim?</h3>
            <p>A <strong>rejected claim</strong> is a technical issue — the claim was not processed due to missing information, incorrect codes, or administrative errors. The provider can correct the issue and resubmit. A <strong>denied claim</strong> was processed but the insurer refuses to pay, citing policy exclusions, lack of medical necessity, or other coverage reasons. Denied claims require a formal appeal.</p>
            
            <h3>How long do I have to appeal an insurance claim denial?</h3>
            <p>For ERISA-governed employer plans, you typically have <strong>180 days</strong> from the denial date to file an internal appeal. For urgent/expedited appeals involving ongoing or imminent care, you may have as few as 72 hours. Check your denial letter for the specific deadline — missing the deadline can forfeit your right to appeal.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I appeal a claim denial even if I already paid the bill?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Paying a bill does not waive your right to appeal the insurance denial. If your appeal is successful, the insurance will reimburse you for the covered amount. Always appeal denials even if you've already paid the provider — you can still recover the money.</p>
            
            <h3>What is a peer-to-peer review for prior authorization denials?</h3>
            <p>A <strong>peer-to-peer review</strong> is a conversation between your treating physician and the insurance company's medical director (a doctor employed by the insurer). Your doctor explains the clinical rationale for the treatment and why it's medically necessary. Peer-to-peer reviews often result in overturned denials because insurance medical directors are less likely to deny care when speaking directly with a treating physician.</p>
            
            <h3>Does my insurance have to tell me why my claim was denied?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Under ERISA and the ACA, insurers must provide a written denial notice explaining the specific reason for denial, the policy provision or clinical guideline being applied, and your right to appeal. If your denial letter is vague or doesn't cite specific policy language, request a detailed explanation in writing — the insurer is legally required to provide it.</p>
            
            <h3>What is an external review and how do I request one?</h3>
            <p>An <strong>external review</strong> is an independent evaluation of your denied claim by a third-party organization not affiliated with your insurance company. External reviews are required under federal law for most plans and are provided at no cost to you. You can request an external review after your internal appeal is denied. The external reviewer's decision is usually binding on the insurer.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I sue my insurance company for denying my claim?</h3>
            <p>It depends on your plan type. If you have an ERISA-governed employer plan, you generally cannot sue for compensatory or punitive damages — you can only sue to recover the denied benefits. You must exhaust the internal and external appeal process before filing a lawsuit. For non-ERISA plans (individual/family plans, some government plans), state bad faith insurance laws may allow you to sue for damages if the insurer acted unreasonably or in bad faith.

            <h3>What if my insurance denies a claim because they say the treatment is experimental?</h3>
            <p>"Experimental" or "investigational" denials are common for newer treatments or off-label drug uses. To appeal, you need strong clinical evidence: peer-reviewed studies, medical society guidelines, FDA approvals, and a detailed letter from your doctor explaining why the treatment is standard of care. Cite Medicare coverage determinations if Medicare covers the treatment — insurers often follow Medicare's lead on what constitutes standard care.</p>
