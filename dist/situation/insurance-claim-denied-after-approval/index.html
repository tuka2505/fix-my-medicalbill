Our mission is to democratize access to medical bill dispute tools so every American can fight unfair charges without hiring expensive advocates. We believe healthcare billing transparency is a fundamental right. All tools, templates, and expert guides are completely free forever, with no hidden fees or premium tiers."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I lower a high medical bill?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Start by requesting an itemized bill to audit CPT codes for errors like duplicate charges or upcoding. Use federal laws like the No Surprises Act to challenge balance billing from out-of-network providers. Compare your charges against FAIR Health Consumer data to prove you were overcharged. Finally, negotiate directly with the hospital's financial counselor, offering to pay 40-60% of the balance as a lump sum settlement."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the No Surprises Act and how does it protect me?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The No Surprises Act (effective January 2022) prohibits surprise billing for emergency services and certain non-emergency services at in-network facilities. If an out-of-network provider treats you at an in-network hospital, you only owe the in-network cost-sharing amount. Violations can be reported to CMS at 1-800-985-3059. This law is one of the strongest patient protections ever enacted and applies to most commercial insurance plans nationwide."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I dispute a medical bill that's already in collections?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Absolutely. Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), you have the right to request debt validation within 30 days of the first collection notice. Send a certified letter demanding proof of the debt, and the collector must cease all activity until they provide documentation. Many medical debts in collections cannot be validated due to poor record-keeping. If the debt is time-barred (past your state's statute of limitations), they cannot legally sue you for payment."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What should I do if my insurance claim is denied?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"First, carefully read the Explanation of Benefits (EOB) to understand the denial reason code. Common issues like incorrect CPT codes or missing prior authorization can often be fixed by your provider resubmitting the claim. For medical necessity denials, file an internal appeal citing your insurance policy's coverage language and clinical evidence supporting the treatment. Under ERISA, employer-sponsored plans must provide a full and fair review. If the internal appeal fails, request an external review by an independent third party—this process is free and overturns denials in 40-50% of cases."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How do I know if I qualify for charity care or financial assistance?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If you received care at a nonprofit hospital, you may qualify for free or discounted care under IRS Section 501(r). Most hospitals offer charity care to patients earning up to 400% of the Federal Poverty Level (about $60,000 for individuals, $124,000 for families of four). Request the hospital's Financial Assistance Policy (FAP) and application immediately. Hospitals cannot send your debt to collections or report it to credit bureaus until at least 120 days after the first bill, giving you time to apply for assistance."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is an itemized bill and why is it important?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"An itemized bill (also called a detailed statement) lists every charge with its corresponding CPT code, date of service, quantity, and price. This is the only way to verify you're being charged correctly. Federal law requires hospitals to provide itemized bills upon request within 30 days. Review it carefully for duplicate charges, incorrect codes, and unbundled services. Studies show that 30-80% of hospital bills contain errors. Disputing errors with evidence from an itemized bill dramatically increases your chances of a reduction."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can medical debt hurt my credit score?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"As of 2023, paid medical debt must be immediately removed from credit reports, and unpaid medical debts under $500 should not be reported at all. Additionally, medical debts cannot appear on your credit report until they are at least 180 days past due. These are significant consumer protections under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). If you're facing collections, negotiate a 'pay-for-delete' agreement where the collector removes the debt from your credit report in exchange for payment. Get this agreement in writing before sending any money."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is prior authorization and why was my treatment denied?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Prior authorization is an insurance requirement that your doctor must get approval before providing certain treatments, procedures, or medications. Denials are often based on outdated clinical guidelines or misinterpretation of medical necessity. You have the right to appeal under ERISA § 503 and request a Peer-to-Peer Review where your doctor speaks directly with the insurer's medical director. Cite Medicare coverage determinations (NCDs/LCDs) and peer-reviewed studies to strengthen your appeal. For urgent cases, demand an expedited review within 72 hours."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long do I have to dispute a medical bill?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Time limits vary by state and situation. For billing errors, act immediately—most hospitals only allow 30-90 days to dispute charges after receiving a bill. For insurance claim appeals, you typically have 180 days from the denial date to file an internal appeal. For collections debt validation, you must send your request within 30 days of the first collection notice. For balance billing violations under the No Surprises Act, you can file complaints with CMS or your state insurance department within one year. Never wait—the sooner you dispute, the stronger your case."}}]}</script><style>

          <p class="info-eyebrow">Your insurance approved treatment but denied payment afterward. Learn why this happens and how to appeal effectively under ERISA protections.</p>
          <h1>Insurance Claim Denied After Prior Approval: How to Appeal Post-Service Denials</h1>
          
        <section class="info-section">
          <h2>Understanding Your Situation</h2>
          <p>You received prior authorization or pre-approval from your insurance company for a procedure, medication, or treatment. You followed all the rules, confirmed coverage, and proceeded with care. Then, weeks later, you receive a denial letter or Explanation of Benefits (EOB) stating the claim is denied. This situation — <strong>post-service denial after prior approval</strong> — is frustrating, confusing, and unfortunately common. Insurance companies sometimes approve care upfront but deny payment afterward, citing reasons like 'not medically necessary,' 'incorrect coding,' or 'failure to meet policy requirements.' While this practice seems contradictory, you have strong appeal rights, especially if you can prove prior authorization was granted.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section class="info-section">
          <h2>Why This Happens</h2>
          <p>Post-service denials after approval occur because:<br><br><strong>Prior Authorization Is Not a Payment Guarantee:</strong> Insurers often include disclaimers stating that prior authorization does not guarantee payment. They reserve the right to review claims again after service and deny based on final documentation.<br><br><strong>Coding Discrepancies:</strong> Your provider may have submitted the claim with different CPT codes than what was approved in the prior authorization, triggering a denial.<br><br><strong>Medical Necessity Disputes:</strong> The insurance company's post-service review may conclude the treatment was not medically necessary based on the actual medical records, even if pre-approved.<br><br><strong>Policy Exclusions:</strong> The insurer may discover after the fact that your policy excludes the specific service or that you didn't meet all coverage criteria.<br><br><strong>Plan Changes:</strong> If your insurance plan changed between pre-approval and service (e.g., employer changed carriers), coverage terms may have changed.<br><br><strong>Administrative Errors:</strong> Mistakes in claim submission, missing documentation, or clerical errors can trigger denials even when prior authorization exists.</p>
        </section>
      
        <section class="info-section">
          <h2>What To Check</h2>
          <p>Gather documentation to build your appeal:<br><br>✓ <strong>Locate your prior authorization letter or reference number</strong> — this is critical proof of approval<br>✓ <strong>Review the denial letter carefully</strong> — identify the specific reason code and denial explanation<br>✓ <strong>Compare the EOB to what was authorized</strong> — verify the CPT codes, dates, and services match<br>✓ <strong>Check your insurance policy</strong> — confirm the service is covered and you met all requirements<br>✓ <strong>Request the claim submission records from your provider</strong> — ensure they billed what was authorized<br>✓ <strong>Confirm your coverage was active</strong> — verify you had active coverage on the service date<br>✓ <strong>Review the prior authorization terms</strong> — check for conditions like timeframes or specific providers</p>
        </section>
      
        <section class="info-section">
          <h2>What To Do Next</h2>
          <p><strong>Step 1: File an Internal Appeal Immediately</strong><br>Under ERISA, you typically have 180 days from the denial date to file an internal appeal. Do not wait. In your appeal:<br>• Reference your prior authorization number and approval date<br>• State clearly: 'Prior authorization was granted, constituting representation that the service was covered and medically necessary'<br>• Attach a copy of the prior authorization letter/approval<br>• Include your provider's medical records supporting medical necessity<br>• Cite your insurance policy's coverage language for the service<br><br><strong>Step 2: Request Full Claim File</strong><br>Under ERISA § 503, you have the right to request and receive the full claim file, including:<br>• All documents the insurer relied on to make the denial<br>• The specific policy provision or clinical guideline cited<br>• Any internal notes or reviewer comments<br><br>Use this information to identify weaknesses in the insurer's reasoning.<br><br><strong>Step 3: Use Our Appeal Tool</strong><br>Generate a professional, legally compliant appeal letter citing ERISA protections and prior authorization estoppel principles. Use our <a href="/insurance-claim-denied-appeal" data-route="/insurance-claim-denied-appeal"><strong>Insurance Claim Appeal tool</strong></a>.<br><br><strong>Step 4: Request a Peer-to-Peer Review</strong><br>If the denial is based on medical necessity, request that your treating physician speak directly with the insurer's medical director in a peer-to-peer review. Treating physicians often successfully overturn denials when explaining clinical rationale directly.<br><br><strong>Step 5: Request External Review if Internal Appeal Fails</strong><br>If your internal appeal is denied, you have the right to an independent external review at no cost. External reviewers overturn 40-50% of denials. File your external review request within the timeframe specified in your denial letter (usually 4-6 months).<br><br>For comprehensive guidance on insurance appeals, see our <a href="/insurance-claim" data-route="/insurance-claim"><strong>Insurance Claim Denials Hub</strong></a>.</p>

Prior authorization confirms that the insurer agrees the service may be medically necessary and covered under your plan, but most insurers include disclaimers stating that final payment is subject to claim review. However, prior authorization creates a strong presumption of coverage, and denials after approval are often successfully appealed.</p><h3>What if the provider billed different CPT codes than what was authorized?</h3><p>This is a common cause of post-service denials. Contact your provider's billing department immediately and request they resubmit the claim with the CPT codes that were authorized. This is often a simple administrative fix that resolves the denial without a formal appeal.</p><h3>Can I appeal even if I already paid the provider?</h3><p>Yes. Paying your provider does not waive your right to appeal the insurance denial. If your appeal is successful, the insurer will reimburse you for the covered amount. Keep all payment receipts and include them in your appeal documentation.</p><h3>How long does the appeal process take?</h3><p>Internal appeals typically take 30 days for non-urgent claims and 72 hours for urgent claims. External reviews can take 30-60 days. If you're facing financial hardship, request an expedited review and explain why delay would cause serious harm.</p><h3>What if my employer changed insurance plans between approval and service?</h3><p>If your employer changed carriers and coverage terms changed, you may have a strong argument that you relied on the prior authorization in good faith. Consult an ERISA attorney, as these cases can be complex. Some courts have ruled in favor of patients who received prior approval under one plan even when the plan changed before service.</p><p></p>
